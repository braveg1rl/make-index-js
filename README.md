# make-index-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/make-index-js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meryn/make-index-js) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/meryn/make-index-js.png)](https://david-dm.org/meryn/make-index-js)

Generates JS code with require statements from given paths.

This is primarily useful for dynamically generating "index files" for files contained in a particular directory, and in cases where dynamic `require` calls won't work because because they can't to be picked up by browserify or similar bundlers.

## Usage

```
var makeIndexJS = require("make-index-js")
console.log(makeIndexJS({"name":"./name.js"}))
```

Yields the following output:

```
module.exports = {
  "name": "./name.js"
}
```

... ready to be written to a file.

`path` can be any value that `require` accepts.
